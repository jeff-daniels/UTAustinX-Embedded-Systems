# About Lab 5

## Preparation

You will need a LaunchPad and access to [TM4C123_LaunchPadUsersManual.pdf](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/spms376e/spms376e.pdf).  
## Starter project

Lab5_FunctionsInC
## Purpose

In Lab5 you will learn how to write software that involves functions, parameters, and if-then conditionals.  
## System Requirements

The Lab5 starter project is the similar to C5_Keil_Starter and C5_Keil_Solution projects developed in the video. All three projects take input from the keyboard using scanf and performs output to the display using printf. It also includes connections to the Lab5 grader. The goal is for you to write a function that accepts two input parameters (length and width) and calculates the area of rectangular room with this length and width. The length and width are in meters and the returned area should be in square meters. Calculate the area only if both the length and width are between 3 and 20 inclusively. Return a result of zero if the length is less than 3, the width is less than 3, the length is greater than 20 or the width is greater than 20. You are asked to write the function Calc_Area.
